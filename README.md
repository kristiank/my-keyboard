* My personal keyboard

Whoever might be curious, I use Estonian dvorak layout with some characters added so that I can write Swedish, Finnish, Votic and other languages comfortably.

I have also added the `BackSpace` to `Capslock`, having Capslock still available with the `Shift + Capslock**.


** Relevant commands
`xmodmap -pke` for showing the current mapping expressions
`setxkbmap ee -layout dvorak` for setting the layout
`xmodmap caps-backspace` for adjusting the capslock to backspace
